2.  Starts 
    
    1.  The swimmers are not allowed a false start. If they jump the start and the starter thinks they are trying to get an advantage (whether intentional or not-it does not matter), they will be taken out of the race. 
        
    2.  For all front/ prone strokes, swimmers are to start from the starting platform. 
        
    3.  For backstroke, swimmers have to start in the water. 
        
3.  Turns and Finishes 
    
    1.  For freestyle, feet have to touch the wall when turning. 
        
    2.  For backstrokes, swimmers have to be on their back when they touch the wall. After this they can then turn around, but they must push off on their back. A swimmer may not roll over and grab the wall until they have first touched it. 
        
    3.  For breaststroke and butterfly stroke, 1. Swimmers have to touch the wall with both hands at the same time. 2. A swimmer may not freestyle kick off the wall in either breaststroke or butterfly.3. When swimming butterfly, both arms must move at the same time. 
        
4.  Takeovers 
    
    1.  Relay swimmers must not dive (feet leaving the starting platform) or start before the incoming swimmer (on their team) in the water has touched the end of the pool in their lane. 
        
5.  Miscellaneous 
    
    1.  Swimmers are expected to bring their own equipment. 
        
    2.  Swimmers are expected to report to their places on time. Failure to do so may result in disqualification from that particular event. 
        
    3.  Not covering the whole distance, not finishing in the same lane as the one they started in, not making physical contact with the end of the pool while turning or finishing, pulling on the lane rope, obstructing another swimmer will result in disqualification. 
        
    4.  If a swimmer is obstructed, they can try again. 
        
    5.  In case of disciplinary infractions, PoCs have the authority to disqualify the swimmer in question.
